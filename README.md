\## 🚀 Overview



This project demonstrates how I combine PPC strategy, Python analytics, and lightweight automation to build a scalable paid media intelligence system.



Instead of relying only on platform dashboards, this engine:



\- Processes raw campaign exports

\- Calculates core business KPIs (ROAS, CPA)

\- Generates a clean HTML dashboard

\- Simulates real backend reporting workflows



This reflects how I approach paid media — as a system, not just campaigns.
